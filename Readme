# Lyrics Generator

This project transcribes a song, translates each line to Malayalam, and creates
both a lyric video and an image containing the entire translated lyrics.

## Requirements
Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Provide the path to an audio file:
```bash
python lyrics_generator.py path/to/song.mp3
```
The script will generate:
- `lyrics_video.mp4` – a video with the Malayalam lyrics shown as the song plays.
- `lyrics_image.png` – an image with the full Malayalam lyrics.
